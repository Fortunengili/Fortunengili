# MiniTrack
# Overview
MiniTrack is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a role-based school transportation management system. The platform streamlines how parents, drivers, and administrators coordinate student transport through structured booking workflows, route management, and operational dashboards.
The system models real-world logistics and scheduling scenarios, emphasizing data clarity, predictable workflows, and role-specific functionality. Each user type interacts with a dedicated interface aligned with their responsibilities.
MiniTrack demonstrates practical full-stack development principles including UI composition, backend-driven logic, database interactions, and workflow state management.
# Features
* Role-based dashboards (Parent, Driver, Admin)
* Ride booking and scheduling workflows
* Route and assignment management
* Trip and booking visibility
* Structured data presentation
* CSV export functionality for bookings
* Backend-managed workflow states
* Database-backed persistence
# Tech Stack
* **Frontend**:
* Next.js
* React
* Tailwind 
* **Backend**:
* Python
* Flask
* REST API Architecture
* **Database**:
* PostgreSQL
* **Other Tools**:
* Git & GitHub
* Postman (API testing)
* Vercel

# Architecture
MiniTrack follows a separation-of-concerns full-stack architecture:
Frontend Layer → Handles UI rendering, routing, and user interactions
Backend Layer → Manages business logic, validation, workflow states, APIs
Database Layer → Stores bookings, routes, users, and system records
Communication between layers occurs via RESTful API endpoints. Workflow state transitions (e.g., booking status, payment state) are controlled server-side to maintain data integrity and predictable behavior.
The system is structured around role-based access patterns, ensuring that parents, drivers, and administrators have scoped functionality.

 # What I'm currently learning:
 1. Advanced React patterns (hooks, context, performance)
 2. API design and authentication
 3. Writing cleaner, more maintainable code
 4.  Git workflows and collaboration
# Goals:
## Career Goal
My long-term goal is to become a strong senior software engineer:someone trusted with complex systems, architecture decisions, and mentorship. 
I’m focused on mastering fundamentals, building real products, and developing the discipline required to deliver high-quality work consistently.
